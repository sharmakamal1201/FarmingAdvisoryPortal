			"White/cockchafer grubs": "The creamy white grub eats away the roots. Main symptoms are ring barking of stem, chlorosis and defolication. The pest is a serious problem in areas where un-decomposed FYM is used. Control measures: Heat treatment of soil id effective.",
			"Root mealy bug": "The pest is a problem in nursery. It sucks sap from the callusing region, mother leaf petiole and axillary buds. This arrests root development; leads to mother-leaf fall and finally death of plant. Control measures: It can be controlled by spraying and soil drenching with chlorpyriphos or quinalphos 0.05 per cent."
